Selenium Class 7

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
in order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
is a unique ID that hold the address of the window or a tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

Synchronization:
is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components the same level
in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the same speed level

Thread.sleep() -- static wait / unconditional wait

Types of selenium waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait

Implicit wait:
it tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
We can say that Implicit wait is a global wait

Implicit wait works with findElement() method

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If you element is found in any time between the given time
the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or action

If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY when you will get an exception
