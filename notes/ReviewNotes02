---drop downs--
whenbever we have drop downs that are mad eusing select class
we can use select calss in selenium to deal with them

the proccess:
1. get to the select tag for that drop down using you driver.findElement
2.create an instance of Select class and pass your webElement
3.we can select any option by value/ by visible text /by index

byvalue;
byindex;
byvisibletext;
