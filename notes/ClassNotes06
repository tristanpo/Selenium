Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:
1. web based alerts/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2. Javascript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium
robot class or third party tools

Types of JS alerts
1. Simple alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth
    //username:password@

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page

Interview question:
How do you handle Alerts in selenium?
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface
